## GLOSSARY

### Aliases Terminology

#### Main types

- s = sword
- bs = big sword
- h = hammer
- sh = shield
- w = wand
- st = staff
- b = crossbow

#### Elements

- P = poison
- V = vigor
- A = aether
- F = fire
- I = ice
- S = stone (technically not an element, but it's counted as one for filtering purposes).

#### Archetypes

- dmg = damage (D affix)
- eff = effect (buff/debuff)
- def = defensive (A affix)
- h = hidden (staves and wands only)

#### Special types

- D = dashing
- T = towering
- C = compound
- R = repeating
- Q = quarterstaff
- B = bardiche
- HH = heavy hammer

#### Examples:

- bsIeff = **b**ig **s**word **I**ce **eff**ect (dI/Chill)
- shPdef = **sh**ield **P**oison **def**ensive
- wFh = **w**and **F**ire **h**idden (Explosive Wand)

### *"Smart Debuffing"*

It's a faster, more efficient method to debuff with ranged weapons.

It counts the amount of times a debuffing weapon is cast, instead of counting the foe's debuffs, eliminating the time it takes for the projectiles to land.
