  x hide toggle
  x time format toggle. Formats:
    x My custom speedrun format (myFormatSpeedrun)
    x Raw frames (as most speedrunners use it)

x Update all location scripts:
  ... Rocky:
    ✔ Prevent Infernal Staff from activating when screen.i = 0, if the movement speed effect is already present.
    ✔ Test elemental debuff shields against phase 2
    ✔ when screen.i = 1 and there's 2 foes (1 normal + the scout), 1v1/unmake the foe to save time.
    x when screen.i <= 1 or in the previous item's conditions, activate the Berserker Staff to deal extra damage to the Scout with Bardiche ability and others before armor runs out.
    ✔ in Phase 1, use defense heal ldtF mode when about to attack and not at maxhp, instead of using the ap shield, to heal faster.
